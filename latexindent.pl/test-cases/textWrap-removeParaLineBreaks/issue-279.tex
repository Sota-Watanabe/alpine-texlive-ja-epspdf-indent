that belongs to the class \FUNCTION{uint8}\lstinline{uint8} -- the elements of the matrix are unsigned 8-bit integers in the interval $[0,255]$. The elements are referred to as pixel values or \INDEX{grey value}grey values and are the gamma-encoded\SIDENOTE{Gamma encoding and decoding is discussed in \secref{sec:10.3.6}. Use the \lstinline{'gamma'} option for \lstinline{iread} to perform gamma decoding and obtain pixel values proportional to scene luminance.} luminance of that point in the original scene. For this 8-bit image the pixel values vary from 0 (darkest) to 255 (brightest). The image is shown in \figref{fig:12.1}{a}.
